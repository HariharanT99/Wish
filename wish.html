    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse1">I've noticed how your eyes light up whenever I receive even a small appreciation 🙃. I never had this kind of person in my life.</p>
   
    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse2">I always believed that everything that happened in my life was for the best. And it seems that includes you too.</p>
    
    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse3">A year ago, I never thought that I was going to get this kind of bond, not even 1%. And I'm sure it won't happen again with someone else.
        Sometimes I wonder if this is real or just a dream 😅. And sometimes it feels like it would be better if it turned out to be a dream 😂.</p>

    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse4">I always felt like I must have done something big to have you in my life.  You gave me lots and lots of good memories and always made me feel so special about myself.</p>
    
    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse5">This part of my life is the best one 💯. Thanks for making it so wonderful. Thank you for being with me. Thanks for being my skincare consultant😂 and helping me glow ✨🥰.
        Thanks for everything. 
        </p>

    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse6">Good people will always get good things.
        You are a pure soul with good heart.
        You will get all the great things in your life. All the best for your dream life.
        Big fan of your courage.
        I'm so so sooo proud of your progress. Go higher; if you ever feel stuck, Hope I'll be here to support you and get you back on track 😜
        - Always hope for the best 😅.</p>

    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse7">I hope you like the above message. Thanks to Chat GPT 😂...  It's much better now compared to when you introduced it to me 😛.
Just kidding 😉, I know that you can feel my words 🥰.</p>


    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse8">
        <b>Once Again Proudly,</b><br>
        Happy Birthday 🐒🦧🐖...<br>
        Keep pushing your limits 😉</p>
