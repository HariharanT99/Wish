    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse1">I have seen the way your eyes glitter whenever I get appreciation, even if it is a small one 🙃. I never had this kind of person in my life.</p>
   
    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse2">I always said that whatever happened in my life was always good. Yes, it shows you too.</p>
    
    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse3">A year ago, I never thought that I was going to get this kind of bond, not even 1%. And I'm sure it won't happen again with someone else.
        Sometimes I have asked myself whether this is real or a dream 😅. And sometimes it feels like it would be better if it turned out to be a dream 😂.</p>

    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse4">I always thought that I had done some great things to have you in my life. You gave me lots and lots of good memories and always made me feel so special about myself.</p>
    
    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse5">This part of my life is the best one 💯. Thanks for making it this way. Thank you for being with me. Thanks for the tips which makes me glow ✨🥰.
        Thanks for everything. 
        </p>

    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse6">Good people will always get good things.
        You are a pure soul with good heart.
        You will get all the great things in your life. All the best for your dream life.
        Big fan of your courage.
        I'm so so sooo proud of your progress. Go higher; if you are stuck anywhere, I hope I'll be there to hold you and put you back on track 😜
        - Always hope for the best 😅.</p>

    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse7">I hope you like the above message. Thanks to Chat GPT 😂... It is way better than when you first introduced it to me 😛.
Just kidding 😉, I know that you can feel my words 🥰.</p>


    <p class="birthday__verse-elements" id="verse8">
        <b>Once Again Proudly,</b><br>
        Happy Birthday 🐒🦧🐖...<br>
        Keep pushing your limits 😉</p>
